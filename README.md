This is a small App using React JS,

I have designed a similar App earlier in the year that used pure JS. This has allowed me to see the utility of the React node.

It has allowed me to see how react responds with business side models and methods.

I have put in some styling.

If you want to run the app you will need to run the npm install in the client.
